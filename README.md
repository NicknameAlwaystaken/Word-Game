## TODO

### Performance optimization
Create cached rotated images

### Gameplay and visual improvements
Game name/Logo show in-game
~~Interactable text/buttons look more like buttons~~
Easier continue, press any key or click anywhere
Menu transition animations
Better spacing between letter buttons, horizontally way wider than vertically

### Passive animations
Background shapes flying around

### Functionality
Local score/save files (maybe)

### Main menu
Start game (button)

Theme: theme_button difficulty_button
