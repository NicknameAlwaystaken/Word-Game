I hope you enjoy :)


## TODO

### General
Name of the game
Logo within the game
Game start animation
Transition animation between menus

### Performance optimization
Create cached rotated images

### Gameplay and visual improvements
Game name/Logo show in-game
~~Interactable text/buttons look more like buttons~~
Easier continue, press any key or click anywhere
Menu transition animations
Better spacing between letter buttons, horizontally way wider than vertically

### Passive animations
Background shapes flying around

### Functionality
Local score/save files (maybe)

### Main menu
Start game (button)

Theme: theme_button difficulty_button


## Ideas
One word a day for everybody.
Shows how fast you guessed word/amount of guesses
Placement in daily ladder based on if passed and with how many wrong guesses.
Getting words correct on a streak adds effects.
